# Simple Pong Game (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

This project is a classic Pong game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player controls the left paddle using their mouse, while the right paddle is managed by a basic AI that follows the ball's vertical position. The game features a bouncing ball, collision detection for paddles and walls, and a simple scoring system displayed beneath the play area.

## Features

- **Mouse Controls**: Move your mouse vertically over the canvas to control the left paddle.
- **AI Opponent**: The right paddle is controlled by a simple AI, making the game challenging.
- **Collision Detection**: The ball bounces off paddles and walls, mimicking classic Pong physics.
- **Scoreboard**: Player and AI scores are displayed and updated in real time.
- **Responsive Design**: The game runs smoothly in modern browsers without dependencies.
